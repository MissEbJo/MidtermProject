#VideoGameMidtermProject

The Video Game midterm project is a project to demonstrate our understanding of what we have learned about Java, SpringMVC, and JPA. Along with a few others.

##Team Members
DBA - Ian Verderame
Scrum Master - Frederick Kaucher
Git Owner - Ebony Johnson
README/CSS - Christopher Lee

##Overview
Hello, World!

To be more specific, this project will enable you to query a database of video games.
Not only that, implementing our friend C.R.U.D, you'll be able to add and edit with your own video games if it's not on the list!(Given your user has the proper permission level)

Which brings us to our next point, A user login will be implemented to give proper permissions to proper users.
For example, a user will only be able to add/remove from the database if they have already logged in.

The way we will keep track of how what the users have done will be to create an account, each data entry will be logged via the users profile's generated id.

The project will have some other features as well, such as each entry having links to related games they might like, other related types of media(such as books or movies), and the functionality to create a list of favorites for each user.

##Project Requirements
Oh look at that, these line up with what you can do in the project. :D

-A fully developed database schema. The database must be connected to your Java code using JPA.
-Our friend C.R.U.D, this time manipulating objects and saving them in an appropriate database table.
-A user log in, which is authenticated by a mySQL table. There should be different permission levels for the users, one admin that can add/update/delete content present on the site.
-A correct implementation of a session object, this can be used to track a logged in user and any changes they make (for example, a shopping cart or favorites list).
-A way to track an individual user's previous experiences on the site. For example if it is a food ordering system, a list of previous orders.

##Lessons learned

Personal goals

Frederick -Writing test cases, pathing,
Ebony-Getting better at queries, Impls, Nav bar functions, pathing,
Ian-Pathing and Login "access" to do functions,
Chris -Writing JUnit test cases for CRUD, Pathing and Login "access" to do functions,

Using and incorporating MySQL workbench to engineer a database. Building out a webpage to convey the data and C.R.U.D functions. Also restricting a users ability to access functions expressed via a simple login feature.
